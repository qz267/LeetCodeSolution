# Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0?
# Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

# Elements in a triplet (a,b,c) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a <= b <= c)
# The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

# Solution:
# This problem is the extension of the problem below:
# Given a set S of n integers, find all pairs of integers of a and b in S
# such that a + b = k?

# The above problem can be solved in O(n) time, assuming that the set S is already sorted. By
# using two index first and last, each pointing to the first and last element, we look at the
# element pointed by first, which we call A. We know that we need to find B = k â€“ A, the
# complement of A. If the element pointed by last is less than B, we know that the choice is
# to increment pointer first by one step. Similarly, if the element pointed by last is greater
# than B, we decrement pointer last by one step. We are progressively refining the sum step by
# step. Since each step we move a pointer one step, there are at most n steps, which gives the
# complexity of O(n).

# By incorporating the solution above, we can solve the 3sum problem in O(n^2) time, which is
# a straight forward extension.
