/**
 * A pile of nuts is in an oasis, across a desert from a town. The pile contains
 * ‘N’ kg of nuts, and the town is ‘D’ kilometers away from the pile.
 *
 * The goal of this problem is to write a program that will compute ‘X’, the
 * maximum amount of nuts that can be transported to the town.
 *
 * The nuts are transported by a horse drawn cart that is initially next to the
 * pile of nuts. The cart can carry at most ‘C’ kilograms of nuts at any one
 * time. The horse uses the nuts that it is carrying as fuel. It consumes ‘F’
 * kilograms of nuts per kilometer traveled regardless of how much weight it is
 * carrying in the cart. The horse can load and unload the cart without using up
 * any nuts.
 *
 * Your program should have a function that takes as input 4 real numbers
 * D,N,F,C and returns one real number: ‘X’
 *
 * Since we are consuming the nuts at a constant rate, eventually we will reach
 * one such transit point where just enough nuts are consumed such that transporting
 * nuts to the next transit point requires one less round trip.
