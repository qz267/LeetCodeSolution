# Palindrome Number
# Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

# Some hints:
# Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)

# If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the
# restriction of using extra space.

# You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the
# problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might
# overflow. How would you handle such case?

# There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
