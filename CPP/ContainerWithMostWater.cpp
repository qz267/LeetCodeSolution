Notes:
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at
coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of
line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms
a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Note: You may not slant the container.

Solution:
Search from left and right using two indices, say x0 and y0. x moves from left to right,
and y moves from right to left. The volume is min(height(x), height(y)) * (y - x).
Search for larger volume than the original volume.
When we decide which index to move and move to where, we follow two principles:
1. Suppose we move from x to right, then the next index x' must have height(x') > height(x).
If height(x') <= height(x), the volume only becomes smaller because the the values of
both (y - x) and min(height(x), height(y) are becomes smaller. Since (y - x) always
getting smaller, the volume will have chance to get larger only when height(x') > height(x).
2. When decide which index (x or y) to move, we always move the index with shorter height.
Suppose height(x) < height(y) and we move y left to y' which height(y') > height(y), the
volume is always getting smaller because (y - x) is smaller and min(height(x), height(y))
is determined by height(x). The volume has chance to get larger when we move x to right,
because the value of min(height(x), height(y)) is getting larger. If height(x) == height(y),
then we have to move both x and y in order to make volume larger.
