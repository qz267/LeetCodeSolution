/*
 Notes:
 Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. You may assume
 that the maximum length of S is 1000, and there exists one unique longest
 palindromic substring.

 Solution:
 Find the longest substring of s and the reversion of s. And find the longest
 common substring with dynamic programmming (O(n^2)). For the longest common substring
 problem, it can also be solved by suffix tree (O(2n)).
