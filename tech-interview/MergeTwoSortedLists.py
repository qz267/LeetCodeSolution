    Question: Write a function, that given two sorted lists of integers as input,
    returns a single sorted list with items from both lists with no duplicate elements.

    Example:
    input: a = {1,2,3}; b = {4,5,6}; output: c = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
    input: a = {7,8,9}; b = {1,8,20,24}; output: c = {1,7,8,9,20,24};
    input: a = {3,3,4}; b = {4}; output: c = {3,4};
    input: a = {1,2,2,3,3,4,5,6,7}; b = {4,5,6,7,8,8,8}; output: c = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8};
