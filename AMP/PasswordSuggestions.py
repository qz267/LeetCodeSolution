    Question: You are designing a New User sign-up form for a website. When a user enters text in the password field,
    you want to suggest possible 'stronger' passwords to the user by swapping in special characters,
    like turning an "a" into an "@". Given a password represented as a string and a character map that contains
    common characters and substitutions, create a list of all possible password combinations that can be created.
