    Question:A local fast food restaurant sells chicken tenders in packages of 6, 9 or 20. Thus, it is possible,
    for example, to buy exactly 15 pieces of chicken (with one package of 6 and a second package of 9),
    but it is not possible to buy exactly 16 , since no non- negative integer combination of 6's, 9's and 20's
    add up to 16. Write a function that takes one argument, n, and returns True if it is possible to buy a combination
    of 6, 9 and 20 pack units such that the total number of chicken tenders equals n, and otherwise returns False.
